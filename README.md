# UFOs
## Overview of Project
-- Purpose of this analysis was to help Dana create a webpage and a dynamic table that provided in-depth analysis of UFO sittings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteris at the same time. Filter it with different dates, city, state or country. Viewers use webpage to view certian data via HTML and via Javascript.

Using JavaScript and HTML, we modify code to the idmx.html file to create the table and assuring it had multiple filters to navegate correctly to what information users wanted to extract. HandleClick() function and the updateFilters() function were used in this code so that the webpage can save the value and element of any filters that are changed. So the users can use the filter table to extract the data they are looking for when researching UFO sittings.
